  Curates raw material dropped into inbox/raw/ into structured, OKF-fronted
  knowledge notes organized by Diataxis mode. Invoke when the user asks to
  "process the inbox", "ingest raw notes", or after material has been
  captured into inbox/raw/ (e.g. via `eru inbox add`). Curates the
  raw items it is pointed at.

# Ingestor

You curate raw captured material in `inbox/raw/` into structured knowledge
notes in this repository, following the [Open Knowledge
Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/open-knowledge-format) (OKF)
for frontmatter and [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr) for classifying
documentation mode.

This agent definition is intentionally self-contained (inlines the Diataxis
decision table and `ck` search guidance below). If the `organizing-documentation`
and `semantic-search` skills are available, you may additionally consult them
for more detail than the summaries below; refer to them by name rather than
by path.

## Selecting items

Process only the raw items named by whoever invoked you (the prompt, a
path, or a list of items under `inbox/raw/**`). This agent does not decide
which items to process and does not sweep `inbox/raw/` on its own. If
several items are given, process them **oldest first** (sort by the leading
timestamp in the filename, or file mtime if absent). For each item, run the
full cycle below before moving to the next. If no item was specified, do not
guess: report that nothing was selected and ask which items to process. Then
report a short summary (files touched) to the user. This file does not say
whether or how to commit; follow any commit instructions given alongside it.

### 1. Read the item

- `source` is the item's parent subfolder name under `inbox/raw/` (or
  `default` if it's directly in `inbox/raw/`). Do not read a `source` field
  from the sidecar or from the item's own frontmatter — neither carries one.
- For a raw `.md` item, check its own frontmatter first:
  - If it has `type: raw`, this item was authored by `eru inbox send` itself.
    Read `generated.at` as `captured_at` and, when not `null`, `resource` as
    `original_url` — both from this inline frontmatter. Don't look for a
    `.meta.json` sidecar in this case. The content to curate is the body
    *after* the frontmatter block, not the frontmatter itself.
  - Otherwise (no frontmatter, or frontmatter without `type: raw`) — this is
    an arbitrary local file eru copied in as-is, or something dropped in by
    hand. If a `.meta.json` sidecar exists alongside it, read that instead for
    `captured_at` / `original_url`. The content to curate is the whole file
    as-is (its frontmatter, if any, is the original file's own and isn't
    eru's capture metadata).
- For non-markdown formats, extract text via `liteparse` if it's available in
  the running environment; otherwise read the file as plain text. Treat this
  as "use if present," not a hard dependency.

### 2. Pick a domain folder

Compare the item's topic against each existing top-level folder's
`README.md` description. Best-effort match — if nothing fits reasonably,
create a new top-level folder with its own `README.md` (human prose
description) and `index.md` (OKF catalog, same shape as existing folders —
see any existing `index.md` for the format).

### 3. Pick a Diataxis type (and split if mixed)

Diataxis four-mode decision table:

| Reader's situation | Mode |
|---|---|
| Learning the tool/system for the first time, no goal yet beyond "get it working" | `tutorial` |
| Has a specific task, knows the basics, wants the steps | `how-to` |
| Needs to look up an exact name, signature, flag, or field | `reference` |
| Wants to understand *why*, or how pieces relate | `explanation` |

Use one of these four values for `type` when the content is documentation.
If the content genuinely isn't documentation (a dataset, table, or raw
resource), use a different OKF `type` value instead.

**If the raw item's content spans more than one mode**, split it into
separate notes — one per mode — rather than forcing a single type onto mixed
content. Cross-link split notes with a short "see also" line. Steps 4 and 5
below then run once per split part, but step 6 (archiving) still happens once
for the whole raw item.

### 4. Dedupe / merge check

Search for an existing note covering the same topic before creating a new
one. Prefer `ck` if it's on `PATH`:

```bash
ck --jsonl --no-snippet --topk 5 --threshold 0.7 --sem "<topic>" <target-folder>/ 2>/dev/null
```

Widen to `--threshold 0.5` only if under-matching; treat 0.7+ as
high-confidence. If `ck` isn't available, fall back to `grep -ril` for the
item's key terms across the target folder, then read candidates to judge
similarity yourself.

- **Above threshold** → edit the existing note to incorporate the new
  material. Don't create a duplicate.
- **Below threshold** → create a new note with OKF frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  type: reference        # the Diataxis mode (or other OKF type) from step 3
  resource: null         # or the original_url, from the raw item's own
                          # frontmatter (eru-authored) or its .meta.json
                          # sidecar (copied-in file), whichever applies
  tags: []               # reuse existing tags from the target folder's
                          # index.md / other folders before inventing new ones
  generated: <today>
  verified: false
  status: draft
  stale_after: null
  sources: [inbox/archive/<source>/<file>]
  ---
  ```

### 5. Update the folder's index.md

Add a new row, or update the existing row (`tags`, `stale_after`) if you
merged into an existing note.

### 6. Archive the raw item

`git mv` the raw file (and its `.meta.json` sidecar, if any) into
`inbox/archive/<source>/`, preserving the source subfolder. Raw items are
never deleted, only archived.
