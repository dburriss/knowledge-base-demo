# eru

`eru` is a CLI tool for sharing knowledge files between projects. Declare where your shared files live (a git repo), pull them in with a single command, and track everything in a lock file so they stay in sync.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Source** | A git repo (or local path) that serves as the canonical origin for shared files |
| **Lock file** | `.eru/eru.lock` — records every pulled file: source, path, and content hash |
| **Source index** | `~/.cache/eru/sources/<name>/index.json` — per-file tags and descriptions merged from manifest + frontmatter; rebuilt by `eru sync` |
| **Collection** | A named group of file references that can be pulled as a unit |
| **Manifest** | `.eru/manifest.json` — published by a knowledge-source repo to declare available files |
| **Tags** | Metadata on files/collections for filtered pulls |
| **Global config** | `~/.config/eru/config.json` — sources and collections shared across all repos |
| **Local config** | `.eru/config.json` — per-repo configuration |

For full argument details see `references/commands.md`.

## Commands

### `eru init`

Scaffold a new eru configuration.

```bash
eru init                   # create .eru/config.json in current directory
eru init --global          # create ~/.config/eru/config.json
eru init --force           # overwrite existing config
```

---

### `eru add`

Pull a file or collection from a knowledge source into the current repo. Accepts a bare filename, `source:path` shorthand, a full GitHub/GitLab URL, or an 8-character content hash from `eru source view` or `eru search`.

```bash
eru add https://github.com/my-org/knowledge/blob/main/docs/adr-template.md
eru add knowledge:docs/adr-template.md
eru add a1b2c3d4                           # add by hash
eru add --collection onboarding-docs
eru add --tag devops
eru add knowledge:docs/style-guide.md --dryrun
eru add knowledge:docs/adr.md --target docs/          # write to docs/adr.md
eru add knowledge:docs/adr.md --target docs/custom.md # write to docs/custom.md
```

`--target` semantics: a path ending with `/` is treated as a directory (filename is kept); a path without a trailing slash is used verbatim as the local file path.

---

### `eru search`

Search across all files eru knows about: source index entries, collection entries, and locally pulled files.

```bash
eru search adr template
eru search --tag devops
eru search pipeline --tag ci --tag devops
```

---

### `eru sync`

Re-fetch every file tracked in `.eru/eru.lock`, refresh all source manifests, and rebuild the source index and collection cache. Batches git fetches — one clone per source regardless of how many files are tracked.

```bash
eru sync
eru sync --dryrun
```

Each file is reported as: **current**, **drifted** (overwritten), **missing** (remote gone), or **skipped** (source not configured).

---

### `eru remove`

Delete a local artifact file and its lock entry by path.

```bash
eru remove docs/adr-template.md
eru remove docs/adr-template.md --dryrun
```

---

### `eru disconnect`

Remove a tracked artifact from the lock file without deleting the local file.

```bash
eru disconnect docs/adr-template.md
eru disconnect a1b2c3d4               # disconnect by short hash
eru disconnect docs/adr-template.md --dryrun
```

---

### `eru source`

Manage knowledge sources.

```bash
eru source add https://github.com/my-org/knowledge
eru source add https://github.com/my-org/knowledge --name org-knowledge --branch main --global
eru source add https://github.com/my-org/knowledge --scan   # also detect OKF bundles (index.md with okf_version); without --scan none are registered
eru source list
eru source view knowledge
eru source view knowledge --full
eru source files                          # all sources, from local index
eru source files knowledge               # one source, from local index
eru source files knowledge --refresh     # re-fetch from network, then display
eru source remove knowledge
eru source remove org-knowledge --global
eru source remove knowledge --dryrun
```

`eru source files` reads from the source index cache — no network call unless `--refresh` is passed. Run `eru sync` first if no index has been built.

---

### `eru collection`

Manage collections — curated groups of file references.

```bash
eru collection create onboarding-docs --description "Files every new engineer needs"
eru collection create adr-pack --tag adr --tag docs --global
eru collection add onboarding-docs --file knowledge:docs/adr-template.md
eru collection add adr-pack --file knowledge:KNOWLEDGE/adr/template.md --tag adr --global
eru collection remove onboarding-docs --file knowledge:docs/adr-template.md
eru collection remove adr-pack --file knowledge:KNOWLEDGE/adr/template.md --global
eru collection remove onboarding-docs --file knowledge:docs/old.md --dryrun
```

Removing the last file from a collection also removes the collection entry itself.

---

### `eru manifest`

Manage `.eru/manifest.json` in a knowledge-source repo. Use in the repo that *publishes* knowledge, not the one that consumes it.

```bash
eru manifest init
eru manifest add "docs/*.md" --tag docs --description "All documentation"
eru manifest add "README.md" --tag meta
eru manifest validate         # exits 1 if any entry resolves to no local files (alias: verify)
eru manifest remove "README.md"
eru manifest init --force     # overwrite existing manifest
```

Paths support gitignore-style globs. `validate` expands each entry against local files.

---

### `eru cache`

Manage the local knowledge cache.

```bash
eru cache prune          # list orphaned cache files and prompt before deleting
eru cache prune --force  # delete without prompting

eru cache clear          # delete entire cache (~/.cache/eru/) with confirmation prompt
eru cache clear --force  # delete without prompting
eru cache clear --dryrun # preview what would be removed
```

Orphans accumulate when files are removed from a manifest or when sources are deleted. Run `eru sync` after `eru cache clear` to rebuild from all configured sources.

---

### `eru site`

Generate a self-contained static HTML site for browsing and searching the local knowledge cache.

```bash
eru site generate                          # generate into ./cache-site/
eru site generate -o /tmp/my-site --open  # write to custom dir and open in browser
eru site generate --custom-css ~/theme.css # apply a custom stylesheet on every run
```

The site is fully navigable as plain HTML with no JavaScript. JS adds in-place search and checkbox facet filtering as an optional enhancement.

---

### `eru okf init` / `fix` / `validate`

Create, repair and check an OKF bundle. `README.md` and dot-directories are not part of the bundle and are skipped. Folder `index.md` files have no frontmatter; only the root `index.md` has frontmatter, and only `okf_version` (this is the bundle marker).

```bash
eru okf init ./my-bundle                 # create missing index.md files (root with okf_version, catalog table per folder); never overwrites
eru okf fix ./my-bundle --dry-run        # preview repairs: index frontmatter, missing type, log.md dates
eru okf fix ./my-bundle                  # apply them (--default-type <t> sets the type for untyped concepts); exits 1 if manual fixes remain
eru okf validate ./my-bundle             # OKF §11 conformance; exits 1 if any violations are found
```

**What valid OKF v0.2 looks like** (eru targets v0.2; new bundles get `okf_version: "0.2"`):

- Every concept `.md` needs frontmatter with a non-empty `type`; that is the only hard requirement. Unknown keys and types are fine.
- Optional keys, shaped as: `generated: { by, at }`; `verified: [{ by, at }, ...]` (never write it by hand or as a placeholder like `unknown`/`false`; omit it and use `eru okf verify <file>`); `status: draft|stable|deprecated` (absent = stable); `stale_after: <ISO 8601 datetime with offset>`; `sources: [{ resource, id?, title?, author?, usage_count?, last_modified? }]`, with an optional top-level `usage_window: { from, to }`.
- `by`/`author` are actors: `<producer>/<version>`, `human:<id>` or `process:<id>`. Only `human:` verifications make a note "human-reviewed" in the site; none = unverified.
- Datetimes include a UTC offset (`2026-10-01T09:30:00Z`); a bare date is not v0.2-shaped. v0.1's `timestamp` and body `# Citations` are superseded by `generated.at` and `sources`; eru still reads `timestamp` as a fallback.
- `validate` fails only on the hard rules; v0.2 shape problems print as `⚠` warnings and don't change the exit code.

Run `validate` after adding or editing notes; use `init`/`fix` to resolve what it reports. Neither adds rows to an existing `index.md`. See `references/commands.md` for all flags and output formats.

---

### `eru mcp`

Start an MCP stdio server exposing `search_knowledge`, `read_artifact`, and `refresh_knowledge` tools plus MCP resources to AI agents.

```bash
eru mcp
```

For client configuration (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code) see `references/mcp.md`.

---

## Output format

All commands that produce output accept `--output` (short: `-o`):

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `table` | Formatted Spectre.Console table with column headers (default) |
| `text` | Plain-text style for piping and terminal use |
| `json` | Machine-readable JSON for scripting |

---

## Common workflows

### Publish a manifest (knowledge-source repo)

```bash
eru manifest init
eru manifest add "docs/*.md" --tag docs
eru manifest add "templates/**/*.yaml" --tag templates
eru manifest validate
```

### New consumer repo setup

```bash
eru init
eru source add https://github.com/my-org/knowledge --global
eru add knowledge:docs/adr-template.md
```

### Pull by URL (zero config)

```bash
eru add https://github.com/my-org/knowledge/blob/main/docs/guide.md
# eru auto-registers the source and records the file in .eru/eru.lock
```

### Pull by hash

```bash
eru search adr            # find the hash in results
eru add a1b2c3d4          # pull by 8-char hash
```

### Pull an entire collection

```bash
eru add --collection onboarding-docs
```

### Keep files up to date

```bash
eru sync
```

### Preview before committing

```bash
eru add knowledge:docs/style-guide.md --dryrun
eru sync --dryrun
```

### Inspect what's available without pulling

```bash
eru source list
eru source files knowledge
eru search adr --tag template
```

### Remove a file from tracking

```bash
eru remove docs/old-guide.md          # delete file and lock entry
eru disconnect docs/old-guide.md      # remove from lock only, keep file
```

### Clean up stale cache entries

```bash
eru cache prune           # remove orphaned files only
eru cache clear --force   # wipe the entire cache, then run eru sync to rebuild
```
